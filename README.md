## CHALLENGES FACED

### SCRAPING
<p> - Since codes of site can change with time, a constant code is really hard to manage and needs to be updated quite frequently since the code breaks if that is not done. </p>
    <p>    - Cloud function can error if any problem occurs in the code which can stop database from updating. </p>
